         I liked Shereefs analogy about a kitchen vs restaurant mindset. That for me, I know will be really important. Not expecting my learning to be served on a platter to my but working hard for it and focusing, and learning with my cohort. 
          
          I can be quite shy around people I don't know, so peer learning sessions will be a bit challenging for me, especially since I definitively have that first fear Shereef talked about - worried that everyone else will know so much more than me. 

          Another thing that Shereef said which stood out for me was "If you don't expose your ignorance, you cannot learn". Gives me some more confidence to ask questions- definitely this week I slowed myself down by stubbornly trying to figure issues out by myself. Won't make the same mistake next week :)

          I've done some training for nursing, and I'm a qualified massage therapist but hadn't yet found something which fitted me as a job. I heard about Dev though my father, who is a bit techie himself, and I reasearched, and got quite excited - I literally have a jar full of reasons sitting on my desk as to why I'm doing Dev Academy. So here I am, one week in, and still as excited.

           I'm really looking forward to getting to know everyone in my cohort, and super excited to be a part of Dev.
