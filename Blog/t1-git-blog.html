        <h3>So git?<h3>
        <p>
          Git is an open-source version control system, which developers use as a tool that lives locally on their computer. It's a program that you run from your command line terminal.
          What it allows developers to do, is save different versions of your work as you build on it - snapshots if you will, that you can revert back to if you accidentally add a bug to your code, or review to see what changes you made. That's what version control is -- the ability to go back to any previous snapshots, or saves of a document, and be able to start work from there again.
          Pretty cool me thinks.
        </p>
        <h3>Then what is GitHub?<h3>
        <p>
          GitHub is an online application where you can store all your snapshots of your work from git (we call them repositories). It is quite simply, a hub for git repositories. One of the advantages of storing your work on GitHub, is that you can collaborate with others on the same project, simultaneously! Using version control, GitHub allows for mutiple people to have their own copy (clone) of the master code. When a new shapshot is created, and added to GitHub it is saved to that persons "branch" of the master code. It can then be merged to create an updated master code. When working as a team, also people use "push requests" which just means that if person A wants to merge their branch of the code, they need to have person B review it and then merge it. This ensures that team leaders can check the code before it is added to the master code.

          That's basically it :) Hope you learned something useful.
